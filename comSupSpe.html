      <td>Computer user support specialists, also called help-desk technicians, usually provide technical help to non-IT computer users. They respond to requests for help in a number of ways, such as in person or by phone, online chat, or email. Help-desk technicians solve a range of problems that vary with the industry and the particular firm. Some technicians work for large software companies or for support service firms and instruct business customers in the use of business-specific programs, such as an electronic health records program used in hospitals or physicians’ offices.  </td>
      <td>Other help-desk technicians work in call centers and take customers through a problem step by step, such as to reestablish an Internet connection or to troubleshoot Wi-Fi routers or other household IT products. Computer network support specialists analyze and troubleshoot computer network problems. They have an important role in the daily, weekly, or monthly maintenance of their organization’s networks. This maintenance may be routine or part of the organization’s disaster recovery efforts. Network support specialists also may assist computer users through phone, email, or in-person visits. They often work under the direction of network computer administrator, who handle more complex tasks. </td>
      <td>Most computer support specialists work full time. Because computer support services may need to be available 24 hours a day, some specialists work nights or weekends. While some employers may require a postsecondary degree or certification, computer support specialists are typically assessed on their overall level of competency, technical acumen and customer service skills. Proving that you can do the job is most important, and being well-versed in operating systems and hardware components, having Microsoft Office training and pursuing a CompTIA A+ certification will help.</td>
