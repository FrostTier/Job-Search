      <td>Sales engineers sell complex scientific and technological products or services to businesses. They must have extensive knowledge of the product's parts and functions and must understand the scientific processes that make these products work. Sales engineers specialize in technologically and scientifically advanced products. They use their technical skills to explain the benefits of their products or services to potential customers and to show how their products or services are better than their competitors. </td>
      <td>Many of the duties of sales engineers are like those of other salespersons. They must interest the client in buying their products or services, negotiating a price, and completing the sale. To do this, sales engineers give technical presentations during which they explain the technical aspects of the product and how it will solve a specific customer problem. Some sales engineers team with other salespersons, such as wholesale and manufacturing sales representatives</td>
      <td>In addition to giving technical presentations, sales engineers are increasingly doing other tasks related to sales, such as market research. They also may ask for technical requirements from customers and modify and adjust products to meet customers' specific needs. Some sales engineers have large territories and travel extensively. Because sales regions may cover several states, sales engineers may be away from home for several days or even weeks at a time. Other sales engineers cover a smaller region and spend only a few nights away from home.</td>
